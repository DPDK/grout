Description: Graph router based on DPDK
 grout stands for Graph Router. In English, "grout" refers to thin mortar that
 hardens to fill gaps between tiles.
 .
 grout is a DPDK based network processing application. It uses the rte_graph
 library for data path processing.
 .
 Its main purpose is to simulate a network function or a physical router for
 testing/replicating real (usually closed source) VNF/CNF behavior with an
 opensource tool.
 .
 It comes with a client library to configure it over a standard UNIX socket and
 a CLI that uses that library. The CLI can be used as an interactive shell, but
 also in scripts one command at a time, or by batches.
